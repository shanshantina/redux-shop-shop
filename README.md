   ![demo](./assets/demo.gif)

  The Redux Shop-shop is an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state: 
  1. When user reviews the appâ€™s store, then user finds that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API. 
  2. When user reviews the way the React front end accesses the store, then user finds that the app uses a Redux provider.
  3. When user reviews the way the app determines changes to its global state, then user is presented with several search results, then user finds that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API.
  4. When user reviews the way the app extracts state data from the store, then user finds that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API.
  5. When user reviews the way the app dispatches actions, then user finds that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API.
